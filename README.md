# Simon-Minigame

Mini game assignment on a full stack web developer course that I decided to expand with more functionality.


## Difficulty


Added multiple difficulties by adding more buttons:

- Normal: 4 Buttons
- Hard: 5 Buttons
- Extreme: 6 Buttons
- Insane: 6 Buttons + randomized locations after each level


## How to play

You'll have to memorize and follow the pattern dictated by the blinking buttons.
